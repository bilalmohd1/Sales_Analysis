# Sales_Analysis about the products
## Merge data from each month into one CSV
### Clean up the data!
The first step in this is figuring out what we need to clean. I have found in practice, that you find things you need to clean as you perform operations and get errors. Based on the error, you decide how you should go about cleaning the data

### Augment data with additional columns
#### Add month column (alternative method)
#### Question 1: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month? 
#### Question 2: What city sold the most product?
#### Question 3: What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
#### Question 4: What products are most often sold together?
#### What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
